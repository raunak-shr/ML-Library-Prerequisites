Basic libraries needed to learn ML/DS are contained in this repo. A basic understanding of these is a must. Its recommended to try and run the codes by yourself to have a basic understanding. Writing the codes side-by-side will be very helpful. There are 2 formats for all the files - a Jupyter Notebook and a PDF of the same. Along with these there are some cheatsheets for quick reference. Feel free to lookup to them.
The correct going order is recommended as - 
* <a href = "https://github.com/raunak-shr/ML-Library-Prerequisites/blob/main/NumPy%20-%20I.ipynb">Numpy - I</a> 
* <a href = "https://github.com/raunak-shr/ML-Library-Prerequisites/blob/main/NumPy%20-%20II%20(Random%20and%20uFunc).ipynb">Numpy - II (Random and uFunc)
* <a href = "https://github.com/raunak-shr/ML-Library-Prerequisites/blob/main/Matplotlib.ipynb">Matplotlib</a>
* <a href = "https://github.com/raunak-shr/ML-Library-Prerequisites/blob/main/Seaborn.ipynb">Seaborn</a>
* <a href = "https://github.com/raunak-shr/ML-Library-Prerequisites/blob/main/Pandas%20-%20I.ipynb">Pandas - I</a>
* <a href = "https://github.com/raunak-shr/ML-Library-Prerequisites/blob/main/NumPy%20-%20II.ipynb">Pandas - II</a>
* <a href = "https://github.com/raunak-shr/ML-Library-Prerequisites/blob/main/NumPy%20-%20III.ipynb">Pandas - III</a>
* <a href = "https://github.com/raunak-shr/ML-Library-Prerequisites/blob/main/NumPy%20-%20IV.ipynb">Pandas - IV</a>

The files have been made by me nevertheless but the sources which I referred to while creating these are - 
* <a href = "www.geeksforgeeks.org">GeeksforGeeks</a>
* <a href = "www.w3Schools.com">w3Schools</a>
* Numpy, Pandas, Maplotlib, Seaborn Documentations.
