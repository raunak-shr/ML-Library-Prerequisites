    "## 0. What are Graphs?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous three guides, you ran TensorFlow **eagerly**. This means TensorFlow operations are executed by Python, operation by operation, and returning results back to Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "While eager execution has several unique advantages, graph execution enables portability outside Python and tends to offer better performance. Graph execution means that tensor computations are executed as a TensorFlow graph, sometimes referred to as a tf.Graph or simply a \"graph.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Graphs are data structures that contain a set of `tf.Operation` objects, which represent units of computation; and `tf.Tensor` objects, which represent the units of data that flow between operations. They are defined in a `tf.Graph` context. Since these graphs are data structures, they can be saved, run, and restored all without the original Python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is what a TensorFlow graph representing a two-layer neural network looks like when visualized in TensorBoard:\n",

    "### The benefits of graphs\n",
    "With a graph, you have a great deal of flexibility. You can use your TensorFlow graph in environments that don't have a Python interpreter, like mobile applications, embedded devices, and backend servers. TensorFlow uses graphs as the format for saved models when it exports them from Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Graphs are also easily optimized, allowing the compiler to do transformations like:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Statically infer the value of tensors by folding constant nodes in your computation (\"constant folding\").\n",
    "\n",
    "* Separate sub-parts of a computation that are independent and split them between threads or devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Simplify arithmetic operations by eliminating common subexpressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is an entire optimization system, Grappler, to perform this and other speedups.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, graphs are extremely useful and let your TensorFlow run **fast**, run **in parallel**, and run efficiently **on multiple devices.**\n",
    "\n",
    "However, you still want to define your machine learning models (or other computations) in Python for convenience, and then automatically construct graphs when you need them."
